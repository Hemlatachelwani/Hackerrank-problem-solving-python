Problem : The factorial of the integer , written , is defined as:

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.
Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer
Note: Factorials of  can't be stored even in a  long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

Solution:
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

# Complete the extraLongFactorials function below.
def extraLongFactorials(n):
    # print(n)
    if n>1:
      return int(n*int(extraLongFactorials(n-1)))
    elif n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
    # return n 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    # print(n)
    print(extraLongFactorials(n))
